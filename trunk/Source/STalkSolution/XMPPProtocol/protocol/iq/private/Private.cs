	/// <remarks>
	/// A Jabber client can store any arbitrary XML on the server side by sending an
	/// iq stanza of type "set" to the server with a query child scoped by the 'jabber:iq:private' namespace.
	/// The query element MAY contain any arbitrary XML fragment as long as the root element of that 
	/// fragment is scoped by its own namespace. The data can then be retrieved by sending an iq stanza 
	/// of type "get" with a query child scoped by the 'jabber:iq:private' namespace, 
	/// which in turn contains a child element scoped by the namespace used for storage of that fragment.
	/// Using this method, Jabber entities can store private data on the server and retrieve it 
	/// whenever necessary. The data stored might be anything, as long as it is valid XML.
	/// One typical usage for this namespace is the server-side storage of client-specific preferences; 
	/// another is Bookmark Storage.
